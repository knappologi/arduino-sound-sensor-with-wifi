# arduino-sound-sensor-with-wifi
Using Arduino Uno, ESP8266-01 and microphone (MAX4466) to capture and send sound level data

## Parts used
* Arduino Uno
* ESP8266-01 as wifi module
* MAX4466 Electret Microphone Amplifier with Adjustable Gain (may require soldering)
* RTCDS3231 as real time clock

Additional items needed:
* Breadboard to connect modules to Arduino Uno
* Jumper wires 
* Battery to RTC (CR2032 or LiRo3032)
* USB-cable to connect Arduino to computer :)

## Connecting the parts 
Make sure to NOT connect the wifi module to anything higher than 3.3v!

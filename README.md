# arduino-sound-sensor-with-wifi
Using Arduino Uno, ESP8266-01 and microphone (MAX4466) to capture and send sound level data

## Parts used
* Arduino Uno
* ESP8266-01 as wifi module
* MAX4466 Electret Microphone Amplifier with Adjustable Gain (may require soldering)
* RTCDS3231 as real time clock

Additional items needed:
* Breadboard to connect modules to Arduino Uno
* Jumper wires 
* Battery to RTC (CR2032 or LiRo3032)
* USB-cable to connect Arduino to computer :)

## Connecting the parts 
Make sure to NOT connect the wifi module to anything higher than 3.3v!

## The code
Included in this project are two different versions.
One, **soundreadings-wifi-httpget.ino** that includes a GET request, through HTTP or HTTPS with generated params. The other, **soundreadings-wifi-thingspeak.ino**, sends data to a thingspeak channel.

### HTTP GET
In this version, theres is two different GET functions. A GET for HTTP and a GET for HTTPS that also uses a method to generate the GET path & parameters. 

In the code: in setup for Wifi, modify the values for SSID and password to match the wifi you want to connect to.

**For HTTP/ getRequestHTTP**:
1. In the method getRequestHTTP change the values of serverAddress[], PARAM and YOUR-HOST. 
1. Change in the loop method to use getRequestHTTP.

**For HTTPS / getHTTPSWithGeneratedParam**:
1. In the method getHTTPSWithGeneratedParam, change the value of server[] and HOSTNAME
1. In the method formatStringForGetPost, change the values of sensorID (if needed/used), and the values of the concatenations of contentToSend. 


### Sending to Thingspeak
1. In the code: in setup for Wifi, modify the values for SSID and password to match the wifi you want to connect to.
1. To send and post data to Thingspeak, an (free) account is needed: https://thingspeak.com/
1. In thingspeak, create a channel for the purpose of uploading data. 
1. After creating the channel, click on the tab API Keys and copy the Write Key to the code. 
1. Modify the value of thingspeakAPIKey to your write key.
1. Compile and run the code :)

The code will simply send the value from the max4466 to the first field of the channel.

### Resources used and refered to within the code
The getSoundLevelReading method is based on Adafruits code on how to [fetch sound level data](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/measuring-sound-levels).
A modification to the end output from the function, based on the calculations made from a [post in the arduino forums](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=432991.0)

In the loop method, client.flush and client.stop as been added to solve a problem when sending data ("No socket available"), according to [this thread on the Arduino forums](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=170460.0). 


## Initial configuration

### Set up IDE & download libraries
If you dont have an IDE for Arduino, download and install such. 

For this project, several libraries are used. In Arduino IDE, additional libraries can be downloaded by Tools -> Manage Libraries...
Install the following:
* Rtc by Makuna - https://github.com/Makuna/Rtc
* WiFiEsp (by bportaluri) - https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp

Make sure the right board, for this project an Arduino Uno, is selected as the board for the IDE and found in the right COM port. 


### Configure ESP8266-01 / wifi module
Using the module, we first configure it to communicate through 9600 baud.
This can be done by connecting the module as shown in the image below, by connecting it to the boards TX and RX, and then by AT-commands configure it to send at the chosen baud rate.

1. After connecting the wifi module, open the Serial monitor. Set it to 115200 Bd and allow both NL & CR.

1. In the top field, write `AT`. If the module responds with OK its ready to communicate and accept instructions.

1. Now, in the top text field, send `AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0`. A OK response should now appear. 

1. Reset the module by sending the following command: `AT+RST`.

1. Confirm that the module now can communicate at 9600 bd by changing the Serial monitor to 6900 baud, and again send `AT`. The response should be OK :)

Now the module can be connected to GPIO 6 & 7 and communicate through these. [Source: Kjell&Co](https://www.kjell.com/se/fraga-kjell/hur-funkar-det/arduino/arduino-projekt/anslut-arduino-till-wifi)

### Configure RTC module
Before using the RTC module to fetch the current time, initial set up to configure the RTC is need.
After connecting the RTC the Arduino, using the library RTC by Makuna, compile and run [following code from Hur funkar Arduino?](https://github.com/kjellcompany/Arduino_701/blob/master/RtcOledSetTime/RtcOledSetTime.ino) to set the time according to the compiled time of the code.
